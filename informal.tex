\subsection{Positioning COMMS and JAMMERS to Defeat Each Other}
Quite by accident, I discovered a body of literature that I deem very
relevant to my COMMS and JAMMERS problem.

This work has an intersection with Multi-Agent Systems in that all the
drones are autonomous systems moving to achieve some goal under
partial information.  It seems that the authors I have read so far do
not specifically use reinforcement learning in their solution but
their solution begs to be extended to an RL framework.  (That said,
see \cite{testi2020reinforcement} for a non-adversarial MARL-example.)

Also, as far as I know, so far, no one [I am not certain of this,
yet], specifically talks about the problem I am interested in with
COMMS and JAMMERS---at least not in the way I have framed it---but the
relevance should be clear.

The problem they discuss is how to control a sensor network (in my
case, move the UAVs) in order to bring in the most information from
the sensors.  They use information-theoretic criteria as their
objective functions.  Beyond information theoretic criteria there are
other objectives that do similar things.

I'll list 2 scantly cited papers \cite{nicholson2007information,
  guerra2018collaborative}.  One more cited but less recent paper is
\cite{grocholsky2003scalable}.  There are certainly more papers
available on Google Scholar, but I haven't yet dug into the literature
yet.  The first paper (2007) was found in \cite{pechoucek2008defense},
a bound collection of papers and not available otherwise.  The second
is a more recent IEEE paper (2018) that is not available for free, and
I have only seen the abstract---but looks even more relevant.  There
are dozens more, but I would have to read more than the titles to
determine relevance, which I will do, of course, in time.

The choice facing me now is to go after \emph{depth} to solve the
COMMS/JAMMERS problem or \emph{breadth} with to understand the full
scope of the MARL field---or some combination.  Actually, maybe it is
two separate projects, so I will await direction from stakeholders.
